# Cake Website for client

## Description
- Worked closely with a client to make a cake website for their business. I also translated the website to English using Javascript. I turned their vision into code.
- The website was made from scratch, I used HTML, CSS, bootstrap, and Javascript. The website is reponsive and it was made with a mobile first approach.
